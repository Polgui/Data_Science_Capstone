# k-means-clustering
This is a small python data science project playing around with clustering algorithms, for the IBM data science specialization on Coursera. 
In the notebook 'Vaud.ipynb', K-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms are applied to cluster swiss cities according to the type of restaurants they contain. 
'Communes.csv' and 'Restaurant3.csv' contain data tables representing information on swiss communes and swiss restaurants, respectively. 
In the report in the folder 'CapstoneReport', results are analysed and interpreted according to towns properties (population, location, etc.)
